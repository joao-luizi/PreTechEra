A collection of Projects i bult before my transition into Tech

## PriJobAide (2014)
This program allowed for the older Vivid cardiovascular ultrasound systems to print to a special printer that only accepted DICOM files.
This collected the images from a network folder (in the medical device) in the form of an HTML page, transformed them into DICOM format, inserted a link to them in a database (SQLite) that handled the print jobs. Last I heard from my formar emplyees they were still using it :)

## SignConf (2016)
This program allowed to place a "confirmed" symbol in PDF documents. It fetched the PDf's from a webmail account and returned them after "signed". It allowed for documents to be processed without having to go there physically (at the time it saved monthly 300 km trips)

## Spiro (Med/Tec) (2016)
These are actually 2 programs. They allowed to make Spirometry in one location where there was no Pneumologist to make and sign the report.
